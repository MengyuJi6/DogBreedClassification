The Wire Fox Terrier, 16 to 18 pounds of coiled energy, is a sturdy, symmetrical, short-backed hunter with fire and intelligence shining in its dark, round eyes. The predominantly white coat is rough and wiry; the V-shaped ears are neatly folded forward, the better to point up the faceâ€™s distinctive, and completely irresistible, expression.
