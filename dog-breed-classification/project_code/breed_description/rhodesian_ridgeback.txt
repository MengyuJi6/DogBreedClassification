The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a medium-large dog originally bred in southern Africa to hunt large game, including lions. It was previously known as the African Lion Hound. The first breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks in the United States was movie star Errol Flynn, who reared them on his Hollywood ranch in the 1930s.
